    <h2>Task#6</h2>
    <p>6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the
        name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the
        whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.</p>
