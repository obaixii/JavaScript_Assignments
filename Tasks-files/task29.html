    <h1>Task #30</h1>
    <p>30.	Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?</li>
        <li>Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
        var userList = ["Obaid","Sham","Zeeshan","Admin","Bilal"]

        userList.push("Khan")

        // Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user
        for( let i = 0; i < userList.length; i++){
            console.log("Welcome to website, "+ userList[i])
        }

        // If user is admin, print special msg , else print normal msg
        for (let i = 0; i < userList.length; i++) {
            // console.log(userList[i]);
            if(userList[i]=="Admin"){
                document.write("Hello Admin, would you like to see a status report?"+ "<br>")
            }
            else{
                document.write("Hello "+userList[i]+", thank you for logging in again."+"<br>")
            }
        }
