    <h2>Task#24</h2>
    <p>25.	Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.</p>
    <li>Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.</li>
    <li>Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)</li>
